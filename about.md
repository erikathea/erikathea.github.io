## Greetings Earthlings!

#### Curious about this site, eh? This is just another random blog site of just another nerd.

Hi! I'm **Erika Thea**. Call me Erika. Call me Thea. Your choice. I will not say my age but since I am Asian I look *younger* than my actual age.

I started to write blog entries in Multiply about my daily life in college and ran a small online tees shop. ~~ *BORING STUFF* ~~ But when I graduated, I realized that I should be organized and have a tiny space in the web. I was sniffing around Wordpress for some time but I don't find PHP interesting enough so I just keep a Tumblr account which is something that I could not brag about. *"I have a Tumblr account. MEH."*

Being in the IT/Software industry added pressure and at the same time inspired me that I could create my own - whatever I need - blog, shopping cart, planner, etc.

Why just now? I am lazy and have a short attention span. I had a hard time balancing my life and work. After 4 years, I decided to take a break and just now I can concentrate on making one of my *"Happy Projects"*.

### How I Made This Site

<blockquote> I googled it! </blockquote>

My main objective in creating this space is for me to upgrade my skillset. So, I decided to use [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) because this is just a static site. I use [Twitter Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for the front-end to make the site responsive. I stumbled upon [Skrollr](https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr) and used it to achieve some simple effects or animations.
